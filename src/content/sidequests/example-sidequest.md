The alarm went off at 3:47 AM, but I was already awake. You don't sleep much before attempting something that will push your body and mind to places they've never been. The Leadville Trail 100 isn't just a race—it's a journey through some of Colorado's most unforgiving and beautiful terrain.

## The Starting Line

As I stood at the starting line in the pre-dawn darkness, surrounded by 750 other runners, the magnitude of what we were about to attempt settled in. One hundred miles. Through the Rocky Mountains. At altitudes ranging from 9,200 to 12,620 feet. The cutoff time: 30 hours.

The gun fired at 4 AM sharp, and we were off into the darkness, headlamps bobbing like fireflies as we began our journey up the Colorado Trail.

## The Finish Line

Twenty-seven hours and forty-three minutes after starting, I crossed the finish line. The silver buckle—awarded to everyone who finishes under 30 hours—felt impossibly heavy and completely weightless at the same time.
