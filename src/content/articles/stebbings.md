Harry was the most impactful speaker I’ve interviewed, as his points were straight to the point and landed with everyone in the hall. Funnily enough, that was his exact message: immediate action + distribution.

He started by asking about our plans after school, probing with short, iterative questions to find the kernel of what we wanted to do with our lives. If all of this is going to zero, and your time is limited, what do you want to do? The idea was simple, actually: why not start now? Why wait?

> “Well… school… university,” someone offered.  
> “Why?” he pressed.

Most of us didn’t have answers. In fact, besides being a doctor, Harry probably has the job most moated with bureaucracy: he runs a VC fund. Usually, the path involves an undergrad, an MBA, an internship, climbing the ranks, then 15 to 20 years later, if you were lucky, you would run the fund. Harry launched the 20VC fund when he was 24.

He emphasised this was possible through distribution. In the social media age, online distribution is the most undervalued asset. His podcast enabled him to build a personal brand, connect with top VC partners, and was the quickest possible way to build a name.

My takeaway: realistically, in this world, all you need is a brand. Money follows a brand, and you can use other people’s money (OPM) once you have credibility. So money isn’t the moat; knowledge and a brand are. Harry’s podcast was how he built both.

Why did it work for Harry when so many others fail at podcasts, YouTube channels, or Instagram pages? What stopped him from failing?

He did fail. He didn’t earn a penny from his videos for two to three years.

That doesn’t seem long now, but imagine dropping out of university to do a podcast. It’s risky. People doubt you. Do you still believe in yourself after two years? Most wouldn’t. Harry did. The lesson is: keep going.

This shouldn’t be confused with testing an idea and it failing. Some ideas are doomed from the start and should be killed quickly.

But the point is you shouldn’t judge solely by early revenue. Instead, use multiple signals and see whether the concept is fundamentally flawed. But if the idea shows progress but slow returns, persist (and obviously optimise/pivot/adjust- just keep the kernel idea).

Anyway, Harry said so much more, but this was what stuck with me: action, distribution, persistence. And of course, check out his podcast: 20VC.
