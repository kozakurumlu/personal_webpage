Matt Cohler wore his school tie to our interview. The same one from Saint Bernard's in New York.  

A guy who was employee #1 at LinkedIn, employee #5 at Facebook and became a Benchmark partner at 30. But he started the conversation talking about failure.

## The Luckiest Failure

Matt tried to drop out of Yale. Twice.  
First to play music. Then to work at a startup in China.

Both times, he went back. Graduated in 2001, two years "late."

That delay turned out to be everything.  
Had he graduated in 1999, he would've walked straight into the dot-com mania and probably taken some "stupid job at a doomed startup" like everyone else. Instead, he hit the market right when the bubble had just popped, at a moment when everyone else was running away from tech.

After the bubble burst, "B2B meant back to banking. B2C meant back to consulting."

Therefore, the ecosystem was tiny, everyone knew each other, and there was room to move without fighting through crowds. The lesson here is that timing matters enormously; you can't control it, but you can position yourself to benefit when the moment comes.


## How He Got LinkedIn and Facebook

After coming back from China and finishing at Yale, Matt needed a job. McKinsey was hiring in Palo Alto because literally nobody wanted to be there, so he took it without planning to stay long. The person working down the hall from him? Sundar Pichai, who's now running Google. It was a tiny ecosystem of those who still believed in the Valley.

A friend at the office introduced him to Reid Hoffman, and they met for what was supposed to be a 20-minute coffee. Six hours later, they were still talking.

"I just wanted to work for this guy," Matt told me. "I didn't care what the job was."

Reid was starting two companies at the time. One was a "digital time capsule thing”, and the other was LinkedIn. Matt picked a person over a company, and that turned out to be the move that changed everything.

This is the play if you're not a 10x engineer, he said: find someone exceptional, attach yourself to them, and learn everything you possibly can. Reid knew everyone in Silicon Valley, so Matt met everyone through him. It was an apprenticeship.

When Facebook needed someone to recruit engineers in 2004, Reid recommended Matt. He made the jump.

## "Right Place, Right Time. Next Question."

Matt quoted Lei Zhang, who runs Hill House, one of China's biggest investment firms. Someone once asked Zhang what he attributed his incredible success to, and his answer was almost dismissive in its simplicity: "Right place, right time. Next question."

There's genuine humility in that response, but there's also a lot of truth. Matt was quick to point out, though, that luck isn't purely random. You can actually increase your odds in a few specific ways.

* Lots of reps. More lottery tickets = more chances.
* Be where things happen. You won't get wet in the desert.
* Stay curious and open. Lucky people notice opportunities others miss.

Matt referenced a study that illustrates this. Researchers gave subjects a newspaper and asked them to count the photos inside as quickly as possible. A few pages in, there was a block of text that read: "Stop counting. There are 47 photos."

The people who self-identified as "lucky" in their lives saw it and finished quickly. The "unlucky" ones kept counting, heads down, missing what was right in front of them.

## The Only Reason Companies Fail

I asked Matt about the most common mistake founders make, and his answer was almost offensively simple.

"Why do companies fail? There's only one reason. They run out of money."

That's it. Every other problem, bad hires, bad product, bad timing, eventually becomes a cash problem if you let it go long enough. The most important thing, before any grand strategy or vision, is simply not going bankrupt.

## On Hiring (and Firing)

Matt spent years recruiting. Here's what he looks for:

* Intelligence (obvious)
* Curiosity (less obvious, more important)
* Humility without modesty: you want people who know they're not special snowflakes but are still wildly ambitious
* Character: hard to assess, but crucial

For experienced hires, do back-channel references. Don't just call the names they give you. Call people they've actually worked with.

But here's the twist: great founders often get terrible references.

One of the best founders Matt worked with had references that all said "disaster, stay away." As an employee? Sure. As a founder? Irrelevant. He crushed it.

The flip side of hiring well is firing well, and Matt learnt this from watching Zuckerberg up close. His biggest insight on this front was: "Sevens kill companies."

A 7/10 employee isn't obviously bad. They're fine, they do decent work, they don't cause problems. But "fine" compounds into mediocrity over time. You end up with a culture of people who are all pretty good, and nobody ever quite hits exceptional. The solution is to fire faster than feels comfortable, which is harder than it sounds because sevens don't give you an obvious reason to let them go.

## What Makes a Great Founder

Matt's checklist:

* Wild ambition without insanity (fine line)
* Ability to learn: the company grows exponentially; the founder must too.
* Curiosity without distractibility: always listening; not always changing direction.
* A calling, not a choice: "Starting a company shouldn't really be a decision. It should feel like: I have to do this."

I asked him: how do you spot outlier founders early?

He quoted Paul Graham:

> "After I meet someone, I notice I came away a little bit afraid. Not scared, but uneasy, that’s a signal for me.”

## PAM > TAM

VCs love talking about TAM: Total Addressable Market. How big is the market today?

Matt thinks that's backwards.

If a market is already big, it's already served. Capitalism is viciously competitive. No room for a startup.

He prefers PAM: Potential Addressable Market.

What could this become if the right founder built the right product at the right time?

Netflix started as a DVD-by-mail company. It was a pretty good business, but not incredible. It had several issues, like annoying inventory management, slow delivery, and shiny discs that break. The Netflix we know today is one of the most valuable media companies on earth. You had to look at Reed Hastings early on and see that this was a person who would keep levelling up, who would transform the business into something unrecognisable from where it started.

## On Dropping Out

I asked Matt what he'd tell a 21-year-old who was debating whether to stay in school or leave to start something. Given his own winding path through Yale, I expected him to be romantic about dropping out.

He wasn't.

"Dropping out isn't a virtue. Finishing school isn't either. Neither one is intrinsically good or bad."

He said the filter that should be used is: "Does it feel like a calling, or are you forcing it?"

If you're sitting there thinking, "I should probably start a company," you probably shouldn't. But if you're feeling "I have to build this thing, I literally cannot do it", that's different. That compulsion is what gets you through the brutally hard parts.

## The Best Place to Build

When someone asked about building companies in the UK, Matt was diplomatic but also pretty blunt.

You can start a company anywhere in the world, and there's no meaningful difference in where you begin. But if you want to scale a venture-backed tech company, Silicon Valley wins.

The network effects, the talent density, the capital concentration, the ecosystem of people who've done it before: "nothing else comes close". Matt has looked at every other market in the world, and his conclusion is always the same.

The UK has incredible academic talent, pound-for-pound, among the best anywhere. But for scaling tech companies? It’s the Valley.

"If you only listen to one thing I say: just go to Silicon Valley," he said.

## The Privilege of Failure

Here's what stuck with me most from the whole conversation.

Most outcomes in life follow a bell curve. A little better than average, a little worse, clustered around the middle. But the tech ecosystem runs on power laws, where a few things are way out there on the extreme end of the distribution.

The culture of "succeed at every milestone": GCSEs, A-levels, get into the right university, hit the next checkpoint, trains you to optimise for the safe middle of the curve. That's fine for school, but it's the wrong mindset for anything entrepreneurial.

Matt's advice flips the usual framing on its head. Don't try to figure out what you want to do. Instead, figure out what you don't want to do. Try things, fail at them, learn what you're bad at, learn what you don't care about getting better at.

Once you've eliminated enough options, you'll have clarity about what's left.

"Good judgement comes from experience," he said. "And experience comes from bad judgement."
