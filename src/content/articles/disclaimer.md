These are my formalised notes from interviews I ran at Eton College’s Entrepreneurship Society. I’m not allowed to share the recordings, so this is the next best thing.

- **Not verbatim.** These notes are **my interpretation**, not direct quotes from the people I interviewed.
- **My POV.** I write from my perspective; bias and framing are inevitable so **take it with a grain of salt**.
- **Selective by design.** I’m a big summariser: if a point didn’t pass my **“is this important?” filter**, it’s probably not here.
- **Fallible memory.** I may miss nuance or get details wrong. **Corrections welcome.**
- **No endorsements.** Nothing here is investment, legal, or career advice. It’s **notes, not doctrine**.

If you want exact words, go to the speakers’ own talks, essays, or official materials. This series is meant to surface the **most useful ideas** as I understood them—nothing more, nothing less. Anyway enough of that, enjoy :)
