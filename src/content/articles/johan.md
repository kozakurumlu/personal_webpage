# What I Learned From Johan Brand (Founder of Kahoot!)

## Design for Emotion

I asked Johan for one piece of advice that aspiring founders probably wouldn't hear in a traditional business class. Something counterintuitive.

Design for human emotion.

Johan was insistent that this is still the thing founders overlook most consistently. Emotion is actually the most powerful lever for innovation because emotional responses are what scale fastest. When you hit someone on an emotional level, they don't just use your product. They tell everyone they know about it.

For Kahoot, the core emotions they were designing for were engagement, joy, and what Johan called "epic win": that feeling when you get something right, and it actually matters, when you're celebrated for it.

Furthermore, the reason everything in Kahoot happens on the big screen at the front of the classroom is so that students have to look up. And when they look up, their eyes meet. They see their teacher. They see their classmates. They're suddenly in the room together instead of buried in their individual screens.

That's it. That's the single most powerful design choice in the entire product. They engineered a moment of human connection into every single session.

Johan told me they literally pinned a picture to the wall showing the exact behavior they wanted to create: hands in the air, eyes meeting, genuine connection happening between real people in the room. Then they worked backward from that image, making every other design decision in service of that moment.

## The Moment That Almost Killed Everything

Early in Kahoot's life, Johan found himself on stage demoing the platform to a room full of investors and educators: people whose opinions mattered. His co-founder was somewhere over the Atlantic on a flight to San Francisco, wearing the FitBit he usually slept with so he could wake up and fix server issues at 3 am if needed.

Except you can't fix servers from 35,000 feet. And that's exactly when the whole system went down.

Johan stood on stage, smiling at the crowd, knowing full well there were hours until his co-founder's plane landed. Seven hours of dead servers, and absolutely nothing he could do about it.

It's the kind of moment that could have ended everything. A classroom tool that doesn't work in the classroom is basically worthless.

From that point on, they developed this deep empathy for what it actually feels like to be the person running a Kahoot when something goes wrong. If you've ever noticed how weirdly reliable Kahoot is compared to other classroom tools, now you know why.

## Breaking Every Rule at Once

When Johan talks about the early decisions behind Kahoot, it starts to sound like a list of things that would get you laughed out of any serious edtech company.

They put music in classrooms. They encouraged dancing, shouting, and celebrations. They let students use their mobile phones. They introduced competition, points, winners, and losers.

Every single one of these broke the established rules about what educational technology was supposed to look like. "Most people advised us against each one individually," Johan told me, laughing a little at the memory. "And then we went ahead and did them all together."

If you want to build something genuinely new, you have to develop a really sharp sense of which rules exist for good reasons and which ones are just assumptions that nobody's bothered to question in decades. The skill isn't about being reckless or contrarian for its own sake; it's about knowing exactly which boundaries actually matter and which ones are just holding everyone back.

## The Party Test

I was curious about Kahoot's design, because it really is unlike anything else in education. It's bright and loud and almost aggressively fun in a way that most "serious" learning tools would never dare to be. So I asked Johan where that came from.

His answer traced back to a pedagogy from the 1700s, of all things, built around the idea of engaging the "heart, hand, and mind." The problem with most educational technology, he explained, is that it completely ignores the heart. It's functional, it gets the job done, but it doesn't make anyone actually feel anything.

When they were designing Kahoot, the team had a simple test they kept coming back to: if this product works at a party and in the classroom, then it's complete.

Think about what that actually means. The bar wasn't "good enough for school"; it was "good enough that you'd voluntarily pull it out at a party with your friends and have genuine fun with it." If you can hit that standard, you've built something people will actually want to use, not just something they tolerate because a teacher made them.

There's a tension in there, though, which Johan was careful to point out. Learning actually requires some resistance. The struggle is part of what makes things stick in your memory. So you want the UI to be completely frictionless when it comes to using the product, but the learning experience itself needs just enough challenge to feel meaningful.

## Finding Problems Worth Solving

A lot of young founders get stuck on the same question: how do you actually find a meaningful idea to work on? I asked Johan what his process looked like.

Start with yourself, he said. Look at the problems you actually face in your own life, or problems that people close to you are dealing with. Some of the best startup ideas come from founders who noticed something broken in their own experience and just decided to fix it.

But you can't stop there. Once you've looked inward, step back and examine the broader ecosystem you're part of. Can you spot gaps that other people seem to be missing? Are there things that should obviously be happening differently but somehow aren't?

The magic happens when you find something that works on both levels: a problem that feels personal to you but also represents something systemic, something that affects a lot of other people, too. If those two things line up, you've probably stumbled onto fertile ground.

## Thinking Global From Day One

Even though Kahoot started with founders based in Norway and the UK, they never really thought of it as a local product. From very early on, they were designing specifically for the American market.

The reasoning was straightforward. The US is the largest relatively homogeneous school market in the world, and there's a pattern where schools in other countries tend to adopt American educational technology pretty quickly. If you can crack the US market, which is genuinely the hardest one to break into, the rest of the world becomes much more accessible afterwards.

Johan had an unusual advantage here that most founders wouldn't have. He'd personally gone through Norwegian schools, British schools, and American schools at different points in his life, so he had this intuitive feel for how they differed. American classrooms used multiple choice constantly and were generally quick to try new things. They were also just more playful overall, less resistance to the idea of games in an educational setting, compared to what he'd experienced in the UK.
