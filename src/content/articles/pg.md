What do you ask someone who’s already written answers to all your questions?

That was our problem when my friend Thenuk and I were preparing to interview Paul Graham, founder of Y Combinator. 

My friend Thenuk emailed him directly: “What should we ask you?”

PG replied: “Ask me why you shouldn’t go into finance.”

At my school, the dream pipeline is well-defined: investment banking → climb the ranks → jump to private equity → make money → start a hedge fund. If I had a dollar for every time I heard that line, I’d have my own fund.

PG said startups are the more logical path to wealth. If you work 10× harder you can get 10× returns; in most finance jobs your compensation won’t grow exponentially. You’re also more likely to work well because you own what you build (and it’s more fun).

So why finance?

The answer isn’t money. It’s prestige (except for the rare few who genuinely love analyzing markets). We were chasing status—the title, the optics, the nods of approval. The need for social acceptance was driving our close-mindedness. We had horse blinders on, fixating on a path without asking: Why do I want this? Why does society want me to want this?

That was my first lesson from PG: don’t get tricked by prestige. And don’t go into finance.  
(He admits he fell into a similar trap by choosing philosophy for prestige: <https://www.paulgraham.com/philosophy.html>)

## Where Startup Ideas Come From

PG used a metaphor: innovation spreads like a growing fractal stain. The edge moves unevenly and new gaps open; the rest fills in behind. If you want to find the gaps, stand at the edge.

Standing at the edge doesn’t mean reading or watching talks—it means building and tinkering. When things break, you see where the stain hasn’t reached.

### A Student Rule of Thumb

- If you’re a student, avoid B2B.
- The fastest way to know a problem exists is to feel it yourself.
- Most of our problems at this stage are B2C.
- Exception: selling to your school if you’re a pro—otherwise, good luck. They’re stingier than the NHS. (Shout-out Luca Health who are killing it!)

Bottom line: build what annoys you. That’s what you KNOW is worth fixing.

## What Makes a Good Founder?

Two qualities:

- Intelligence
- Determination

You need both for an innovative startup. Remove intelligence, and determination can still make you rich in a non-innovative business (e.g., construction). But for new edges of the stain, you need both.
